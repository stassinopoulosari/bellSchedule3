# Bell Schedule App
**Ari Stassinopoulos**

**Version 3.1.0**

## what is this?

The DHS Bell Schedule App is a project supported by the Dublin High School Parent Faculty Student Organization (PFSO), built and maintained by Ari Stassinopoulos. The app keeps track of the bell schedule at Dublin High and allows students to keep track of their time during school hours. Students may use the home screen widget, the notifications, or the app itself for reminders of when the current class period ends.

## why?

DHS students often have long walks between classes with only six minutes to make them. Additionally, the class periods have non-standard ending times and often change day-to-day, so the app provides a nice reminder.

## what is the technology?

The iOS app is written in Swift using the SwiftUI framework. All backend data is processed via Firebase. I also built myself a [CRUD system](https://github.com/stassinopoulosari/ubsacrud) to maintain the data in the backend in HTML and JavaScript.

## where can I download this?

Please download the mobile app from the App Store at https://appstore.com/adonisstassinopoulos/dhsbellschedule or https://ari-s.com/bell.
